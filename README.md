# InterviewPractice

A collection of solutions to common interview questions.

The coding examples here have been taken form external sources, including websites like [CodeSignal](https://app.codesignal.com/).
I'll do my best to credit the sources where applicable.
If you've come looking for solutions for these problems for your own assessments, please attempt them yourself before utilizing this repo.
Your next employer wants to see how you tackle the problem!

## Running Locally

Many of my solutions will be written in Python because of how fast it is to script with.

### Installation

To run the python examples locally you'll want Python (3.8 or higher is preferred), `pip3`, and `pipenv` all installed.
Run `pipenv install` at the base of the repo and make sure to either point your IDE at the virtual environment created or run `pipenv shell` before running any tests.

### Executing Tests

Simply run `python test.py` inside any problem folder with the `pipenv` running to execute the tests for that problem.
